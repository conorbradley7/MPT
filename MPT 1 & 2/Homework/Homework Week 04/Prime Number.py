                    Output: Answer to the question: Is This Number Prime?
                             How To Do It: (1) Put The Number Through The Tests:
                                                             (i) Test if n = 2
                                                             (ii) Test if n % 2 = 0
                                                             (iii) Repeat (ii) for range{3, 4, ..., n-1}
                                                             
                                                    (2) Print This Number Is Prime or This Number Is Not Prime

      n = int(input('Number ='))

      if n == 2:
